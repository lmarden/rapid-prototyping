# Design Thinking and Rapid Prototyping Term Project
### Lucas Marden

## Description
This page contains information related to the term project for 22.03: Introduction to Design Thinking and Rapid Prototyping. The project, quite broadly, is to design some sort of intervention that captures energy from the environment, and uses it to do something.


## Biography
My name is Lucas, I am a sophomore at MIT. I am majoring in [Course 3](https://dmse.mit.edu/undergraduate/programs/3) (Materials Science and Engineering) with a minor in [Energy Studies](https://energy.mit.edu/education/undergraduate/minor/), a concentration in [French](https://registrar.mit.edu/registration-academics/academic-requirements/hass-requirement/hass-concentrations), and a certificate from the NEET Climate and Sustainability Systems thread, [Energy Transition track](https://neet.mit.edu/threads/rem). I am the co-President of the [MIT Gymnastics Team](http://gymnastics.mit.edu/), and am currently UROPing at the [Electrochemical Energy Lab](https://www.rle.mit.edu/eel/).



## Precedent Information
Utilizing environmental energy is at the very core of human life. From fueling fires with wood, to the industrial age and the use of coal, then oil, and now a transition towards sustainable energy sources like wind and solar power, humans have always relied on the environment to provide energy for various activities. This project is meant to focus on a renewable, sustainable utilization of energy from the environment, in order to help the planet and the people that live on it. For inspiration, we can look to some past technologies/projects as precedent.

### Solar Panels
One of the most obvious sustainable uses of energy is [solar panels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_panel). These devices utilize the photovoltaic effect to convert the energy in sunlight into usable electricity. They are only ~11-15% efficient, but are nonetheless a very promising technology in the fight against climate change. ![](solarpanels3-mbl.jpeg)

### Wind Turbines
Another technology commonly associated with sustainability is the [wind turbine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_turbine). Wind turbines convert mechanical (rotational) energy provided by the wind into electricity. Much like solar panels, wind turbines suffer from the issue of intermittency. ![](/Users/lucas/Desktop/wind_turbine.jpeg)

Though these technologies are helpful on the large scale, they are both established and much larger scale than any device possible to be constructed in the course of just one semester. Thus, we look to some smaller-scale projects and technologies that attempt to use sustainable energy sources to help people on a more personal level.


### Occa Solar Light
The [Occa Solar Light](https://occa.namenesolar.com/) is a solar-powered, portable light. This company pledges to donate one of its devices to a person with no access to electricity for each light purchased; they intend to help people have better access to sustainable light sourcesfor better safety and ability to read, study, or work at night.

### Solar Cooking
The picture below demonstrates one technoogically simple intervention that focuses the sunlight from a wide area towards a pot, allowing for zero-emissions cooking (only on sunny days, of course). ![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/proxy/xzUGykvimzQ0Iz1l3qw2jEVVbd_tKnBXfQMmKi7yjCpSA8qgyQgHT9tGDFExFOdsZx5EEhmj5XWBgbYLN-CVvQfYsPLmSPAmT6VKiYiuF8UebivcozVls44)
