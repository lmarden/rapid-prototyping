# Design Thinking and Rapid Prototyping Term Project
### Lucas Marden

## Week 4
In the fourth week, we narrowed down to a specific project, though not all of the details have been worked out yet. The class discussed the methods of energy collection, storage, and use at quite some length, that we had spent the third week brainstorming and researching. By the end of the group brainstorm session, we had the following criteria/outline for the project:

**Audience**: MIT Students
**Energy Source / Collection Method**: Solar / Direct Heating
**Energy Storage**: Large block or bath of a solid or liquid
**Use**: Cooking

To get started on the specifics of the project, we have also asked ourselves and started to answer the following questions:

1. What are some precedents for renewable, on-demand, and off-grid cooking? How do they collect, store, and use energy?
2. What temperature ramges are involved in different cooking techniques (e.g. for grilling vs. searing vs. baking vs. boiling) 
3. Which material(s) should be used for energy storage?
4. How can we ensure that the heat storage container can transfer heat to the cooking surface quickly enough to reach cooking temperatures?
