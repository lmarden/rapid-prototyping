# Design Thinking and Rapid Prototyping Term Project
### Lucas Marden

## Week 4
In the fourth week, we narrowed down to a specific project, though not all of the details have been worked out yet. The class discussed the methods of energy collection, storage, and use at quite some length, that we had spent the third week brainstorming and researching. By the end of the group brainstorm session, we had the following criteria/outline for the project:

**Audience**: MIT Students   
**Energy Source / Collection Method**: Solar / Direct Heating   
**Energy Storage**: Large block or bath of a solid or liquid    
**Use**: Cooking     

To get started on the specifics of the project, we have also asked ourselves and started to answer the following questions:

1. What are some precedents for renewable, on-demand, and off-grid cooking? How do they collect, store, and use energy?
2. What temperature ramges are involved in different cooking techniques (e.g. for grilling vs. searing vs. baking vs. boiling) 
3. Which material(s) should be used for energy storage?
4. How can we ensure that the heat storage container can transfer heat to the cooking surface quickly enough to reach cooking temperatures?

Some brief preliminary answers are provided below. I joined the materials / energy storage team, so my research so far has mainly been focus on questions 1 and 3.

#### Precedents
[Phase Change Thermal Storage](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0038092X21002280): A paper describing the storage of thermal energy by heating erythritol. The energy is released by forcing crystallization of the material, allowing for high temperature cooking, even after sunset. Energy is collected using a solar panel, and the erythritol degrades after a few months of cycling.    
[Performance Comparison of Erythritol and Xylitol](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S245190491930246X): Explores the performance differences between erythritol (the material mentioned above) and another compound, xylitol. The materials are tested in a "double spiral coil latent heat storage system".
[Wilson Solar Grill](https://solarcooking.fandom.com/wiki/Wilson_Solar_Grill): Description of a solar grill designed and manufactured by former MIT Mechanical Engineering Professor David Wilson, that uses lithium nitrate for latent heat storage, allowing for cooking after sundown. The lithium nitrate is heated directly by sunlight with a [Fresnel Lens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fresnel_lens).   
[Solar Thermal Fuels](https://tatacenter.mit.edu/portfolio/solar-thermal-fuels/): A look into some current work from MIT Materials Science Department Head Jeffrey Grossman, studying materials that store thermal energy for up to a few days, which can then release heat in order to be used for cooking.
