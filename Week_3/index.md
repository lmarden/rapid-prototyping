## Week 3
In the third week, we brainstormed a list of possible projects that might fit the project goal, while remaining within some reasonable boundaries. Some notable items from that list (though this is in no way the complete list):
 - rechargeable handwarmers with a solar-powered boiler (for the cold winters in Cambridge)
 - a rain capture pavillion that generates electricity using a water turbine
 - waste water heat capture system, which might be used to head sidewalks/roads to reduce the need for road salt
 - renewable energy powered, portable grill / stove for picnics / BBQ
 - wind-powered dynamic sculpture
 - solar/wind-powered food cooling/preservation system
 - pavillion with a solar-powered grill and wind-tower based cooling system

During a further ideation session, my team fleshed out some ideas related to the last concept. We talked about several different aspects of the design, and though we haven't yet fully decided on every part, we made a lot of progress thinking about the design. The overall design will look something like this:

As is seen above, the design includes a 3m radius circular rooftop, which is composed of a parabolic mirror. This mirror will be covered with a transparent dome in a more traditional roof shape, to ensure that the building sheds rain. The light trapped by the mirror will be focused through a hole in the roof and down through a tube covered on the inside with mirrors (like in a skylight in a home). The light will all be channeled towards a heating element. This may either be directly channeled towards a flat-top grill plate (which would lead to effectively uncontrolled heating), or towards a heat sink/source which would allow for control of the cooking temperature.

Some possible ideas for this heat sink/source were: pressurized water, molten salt, and a large block of metal. Ultimately, the first two are unrealistic due to safety concerns. The third, however, might be possible, so long as the block could be properly insulated to ensure the safety of grill users, and had the proper heat capacity and thermal conductivity to heat the grill. This block of metal could serve to regulate variations in sunlight concentration, and also to control the heating temperature of the grill surface.
