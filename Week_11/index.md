### Week 11
During the 11th week of class, we finished building the heat transfer mechanism prototype, and then began some preliminary tests of its heat transfer and insulation capabilites (in the on and off states, respectively). I also helped out with cutting some wood for the insulation project; the wood is intended to provide a barrier to keep insulating fire bricks in place around the thermal battery.


#### Insulation Project
To form the outer casing of the insulation, I helped cut out and sand a few pieces of plywood. Cutting was done using a bandsaw, and sanding was done on a belt sander, as shown below.

#### Finishing up the Prototype
To get to a more usable prototype, I cut a last slot in the block which originally had slots cut in it. Because the block is now thinner than when slots were originally cut in it, I had to cut a more shallow slot. The block is shown below clamped into the milling machine; it is clear that the original slots extend beneath the height of the clamp. I decided to cut the last slot more shallow in order to guarantee that I could clamp the block very solidly during milling.

After the slots were all cut, I cleaned up the prototype to remove any metal chips or oil on the surface. I also filed all edges to remove any risk of cut fingers while handling. I cleaned the surfaces with [Gojo Natural Orange Pumice Hand Soap](https://www.gojo.com/en/Product/0955-02) and used a metal brush to scrub in the slots. My cleaning station is pictured below:

#### Temperature Testing
Now that we have a prototype ready, we wanted to evaluate its performance before attempting to use it for cooking. My general strategy was to heat the bottom of the mechanism with a hot plate, and measure the temperatures at the top and bottom surfaces over time. More specifically, I did this by pressing a thermocouple to the inner surface of the bottom piece of the mechanism, and used an infrared thermometer to find the temperature of the top surface. The setup is shown below:

I collected some specific dat during the test, but the experiment was not done in the most scientific manner, so I won't list all the data here. Instead, I can include broadly what I learned from the test:
* The prototype is a pretty good insulator in the off state. However, this has limits; after a long time, the temperatures on the two surfaces begin to equalize. This is likely due to the very good contact between the ends of each half of the prototype (I measured a higher temperature at the side of the mechanism on top of this area of high contact, and it was higher than the temperature of the other side).
* The prototype is fairly efficient as a conductor in the on state. It took some time to heat up, but its heating rate was markedly faster in the on state.
* Aluminum has a pretty high specific heat capacity. The block stayed hot for a long time after the test. This likely means that temperature modulation with the mechanism may not be super effective, especially in the case of going from high to low temperature. The block may cool down more quickly when it has something to sap a lot of its energy (e.g. food) rather than just the air and the hot plate (which was itself already at a higher temperature). 
* We will almost certainly need to cut a final slot on the end of each half, in order to prevent such high levels of conduction in the off state.


Looking forward to next week, we will likely be adding the last slot to each block, and starting to assemble components with the other teams on the project.
